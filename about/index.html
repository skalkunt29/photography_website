<p>I'm a PhD student in the Computer Science department at CU Boulder, where my day-to-day life revolves around research and study. However, photography has been a constant companion for many years, offering a creative escape and a way to connect with the world around me.</p>

<p>I find myself drawn to the grandeur of landscapes and the intricate beauty of wildlife. Whether capturing the rugged peaks of the Boulder Flatirons or the majestic Royal Bengal tigers of India, I aim to showcase the natural world's raw and untamed beauty. I also enjoy photographing flowers and people, often within the context of larger landscapes, where they become part of the broader scene rather than the sole focus.</p>

<p>David Yarrow is one of my favorite photographers, and I take a lot of inspiration from his ability to capture deep emotions and incredible detail in his high-resolution images. Similarly, Magnus Berggren (mankeyfoto) inspires me with his unique editing style, particularly in his wildlife photography.</p>

<p>I approach photography with a deep passion, always seeking to capture the essence of a scene. Iâ€™m particularly drawn to dramatic lighting and cloud formations, which add a dynamic and emotional depth to my images. My work is inspired by the beauty of the natural world, and I strive to create images that evoke a sense of wonder and connection.</p>
